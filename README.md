# CodeChef Contest Log

### 🔗 My CodeChef Profile
[Visit My CodeChef Profile](https://www.codechef.com/users/next_mount_23)

This repository contains my personal archive of CodeChef contest problem-solving attempts. It includes:

- ✅ Fully accepted solutions
- ⚠️ Partial solutions (passed sample inputs but failed hidden test cases)
<!-- - ❌ Incorrect attempts (to learn from mistakes) -->

### 🗂️ Folder Structure
Each contest has its own folder, and inside each are the problem files named by their titles.  
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- LongChallenge-June2025/
├── FLOW001.java // ✅ Accepted
├── CHEFABC.java // ⚠️ Fails hidden test cases -->


### 📌 Notes
- I use this log to track my progress and learn from past contests.
- Commit messages indicate the problem status (Accepted, fails hidden test cases)
<!-- (Accepted, Partial, Wrong Answer, etc.). -->
- Solutions are written primarily in C++.
